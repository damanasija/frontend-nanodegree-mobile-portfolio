## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

## Steps to build the dist folder
* Note - I've automated all minifying with the help of gulp.
0. Pre-requisites: make sure you have `gulp` and `npm` installed on the machine.
1. When in the root of the project, open a terminal window.
2. In the terminal, run `npm install`.
3. To make sure you don't have any dist folder prior to the build, run `gulp clean` in the terminal.
4. Run `gulp default`. This will make the dist folder which contains all the processed code with optimizations like minifying, optimizing images etc.
5. Optional - `gulp deploy` deploys the dist folder on the `gh-pages` branch of this project's repository. It does require making a new orphan branch and removing all code from the newly created branch and then pushing changes to GitHub.

## Optimizations
1. General Optimization (Mostly automated by gulp)
   + Minified css, html and js
   + resized pizzeria.jpg to optimize quality
2. Related to CRP
   + Minified css made inline for better optimization score
   + added async to external js
   + removed google fonts
   + moved all js to bottom of body
3. 60 FPS animations in Main.js
   + Prevented default scroll and made custom function to animate scroll
   + Local functions made global
   + used translate3d
   + Avoiding recalculations and moved dom queries out of loop in certain areas
